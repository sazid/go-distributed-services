# Go Distributed Services

A very simple implementation of distributed system and service communication
learn how things work at large.

## Run

```sh
$ make all
```

Now run these three services from separate terminals (in the exact order):

```sh
$ ./bin/registryservice
$ ./bin/logservice
$ ./bin/gradingservice
```
